rtreego

## ABOUT

rtreego is a library for efficiently storing and querying spatial data
in the Go programming language.

The R-tree is a popular data structure for efficiently storing and
querying spatial objects; one common use is implementing geospatial
indexes in database management systems.  The variant implemented here,
known as the R*-tree, improves performance and increases storage
utilization.  Both bounding-box queries and k-nearest-neighbor queries
are supported.

R-trees are balanced, so maximum tree height is guaranteed to be
logarithmic in the number of entries; however, good worst-case
performance is not guaranteed.  Instead, a number of rebalancing
heuristics are applied that perform well in practice.  For more
details please refer to the references.

## STATUS
